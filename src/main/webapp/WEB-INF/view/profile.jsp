						<b><font size="20px">A</font></b>ndhra University is not just one
						of the oldest educational institutions in the country, but is also
						the first to be conceived as a residential and
						teaching-cum-affiliating University, mainly devoted to
						post-graduate teaching and research.<br> <br> The people
						of the State have an emotional attachment to the institution,
						since it came into being after a prolonged and collective struggle
						of the Telugu elite for a University in the educationally backward
						northern Circars and Ceded districts of the erstwhile Madras
						Presidency.<br> <br> Andhra University was constituted
						by the Madras Act of 1926. The 82-year-old institution is
						fortunate to have Sir C.R. Reddy as its founder Vice-Chancellor,
						as the steps taken by this visionary proved to be fruitful in the
						long run.<br> <br> Former President of India Dr.
						Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was one of its Vice-Chancellors who
						succeed Dr.C.R.Reddy in 1931. The University College of Arts was
						inaugurated on 1 st July, 1931. The inaugural courses were Telugu
						language and literature, History, Economics and Politics. A year
						later, the College of Science and Technology came into being with
						Honours courses in Physics and Chemistry. The University pioneered
						in introducing many new courses in Science, Arts, Management and
						Engineering in the country.<br> <br> The leaders of the
						university always believed that excellence in higher education is
						the best investment for the country and engaged the services of
						famous educationists such as Dr. T.R. Seshadri, Dr.S.Bhagavantham,
						Professor Hiren Mukherjee, Professor Humayan Kabir and Dr.
						V.K.R.V. Rao, to mention a few who set high standards for teaching
						and research. Nobel Lariat C V Raman was the proud alumnus of the
						University and closely associated in laying research foundations
						in Physics. Padmavibhushan Prof.C.R Rao, the renowned statistician
						of the world, was also the proud alumnus of the University.<br>
